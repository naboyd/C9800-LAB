# C9800 Next Gen Lab Rambelings

Core to this lab is running the C9800-CL in a KVM enviroment on an Intel NUC platform.   This combination was selected due to the compact nature of the NUC and the low power and noise of the platform as-well.  KVM on Ubunut was selected due to the dirver support for the NUC platform and the ability to run other services on the host (dhcpd, dns etc.) VMWare requires licenses, VCenter, and special driver builds for the NUC. 

## Lab Organization

ASA - Outside / NAT services Outside interface does DHCP , intent is to connect to Cisco / Partner network to connect the LAB to the internet.  For Cisco Networks please request IOT access for the MAC address of the Outside interface G/1 from the eSTORE application. 

C9300-24 Main Router/switch for the network.  

Two NUC platforms running 32GB RAM , 1TB HD and QuadCore 8th Generatioin i7s are the base build.  

LABNUC01 is running isc-dhcp-server, ntp , bind9 and KVM with the following Virtuial Machienes
LABNUC02 is running isc-dhcp-server failover unit and pods 05-08

### VLAN Structure

VLAN 10 - Management VLAN , This is where all the Students will end up when they connect to the Lab SSID @9800-LAB
VLAN 1 - Host Managment ports for NUC hosts.
VLAN 1x1 - Pod AP where x = pod number
VLAN 1x0 - Pod Clients where x = pod number

### PODs

VM POD00 - Master Pod for all the students to connect to.
VM ISE - ISE Node - 8GB RAM - 200GB HD Space
VM POD01 - POD08  Student Pods
C9800-CLs configured with 4gb ram 8gb of Disk 4gb is lower then minimum requiremtnt but i have not experienced any issues so far.

### Infrastructure

ASA - configuration
ASA is configured with three interfaces, Inside , Outside and MGMT.

C9300-24:

The switch is configured with one managment VLAN , VLAN 10 - 10.10.10.XXX subnet , and then two vlans per pod, 10.10.1x0 and 10.101.1x1 little x being pod number 1-8  clients on pod .1x0 and APs on .1x1
